Specifics about the infrastructure
----------------------------------

Secondary server:
-----------------
This server will always be passive. It will only be active during important occasions such as system update, server failure or congested traffic.

Load balancer:
--------------
The load balancer connected to the secondary server is configured to be a weighted algorithm that will always favor the load balancer serving the primary servers.
