0. Simple Web Stack
===================

Procedure of Communication
--------------------------

1) The client uses a browser to request access to a website domain called www.foobar.com. The browser sends the request to the router.

2) On picking the signal, the router retrieves the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the web domain from the Domain Name System (DNS).

3) The DNS responds with the corresponding IP address (8.8.8.8) of the server.
Now, the router makes HTTP/S requests from the specific server identified by the IP address 8.8.8.8.

4) Once called upon, the server responds to the HTTP/S request from the router. The router sends this back to the clientâ€™s browser.

Faults with this infrastructure
-------------------------------

* SPOF (Single Point of Failure): The SPOF of a design is that component or set of components that causes the whole system to crash once they malfunction. This design has a lot of SPOFs such as the single DNS provider, the single server and the single router.
Once any of them malfunctions, the whole system will be rendered useless as no work can be gotten from them anymore.

* Downtime: This is a measure of how long the system remains inactive during its lifetime.
