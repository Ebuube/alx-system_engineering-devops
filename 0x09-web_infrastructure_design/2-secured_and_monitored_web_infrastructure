ADDITIONAL ELEMENT
------------------

FIREWALLS: Firewalls are used to protect transmission systems.

SSL CERTIFICATE: SSL certificate is used to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted/shared between two devices. This ensures that if data leeks out during transmission, it will be useless to the attacker. Only the bearers of the SSL certificate can understand the data being transmitted.

MONITORING CLIENTS: These are addons that log information from the servers and devices on the network. Then, they transmit the information to the monitor of the system administrator. Some monitoring clients include Sensu, Zabbix and Prometheus.


SPECIFICS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE
-------------------------------

WHAT ARE FIREWALLS FOR?
Firewalls use well organized protocols to filter and prevent unwanted HTTP/S requests (or from unwanted clients). This ensures that unwanted requests donâ€™t get restricted information from the servers.

HOW THE MONITORING TOOL COLLECTS DATA
The Zabbix monitoring tool collects data for monitoring through several agents that are installed on the monitored hosts. The agents collect data such as CPU usage, network statistics, memory usage and other system parameters. The collected data may be encrypted before it is sent to the Zabbix server for processing and storage.

HOW TO MONITOR MY WEB SERVER QPS
Web server Queries Per Second (QPS) is a measure of the number of requests/queries attended by the web server per second. To monitor my web server QPS, I can use the tool Paessler Routers Traffic Grapher (PRTG). It will provide even other functionalities to facilitate the interpretation of the Queries per second.


ISSUES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE
-------------------------------

TERMINATING SSL: The terminating SSL is an issue in this infrastructure since the data flowing between the web servers and the load balancer are now unencrypted, they will be vulnerable to Man-In-The-Middle-Attack. If an attackers ever gets in between the servers and tha balancers, he will be able to use the information since it is no longer encrypted.

ONE MYSQL SERVER (WRITING): Having one MySQl server for writing raises an important issue. In a scenario when the main MySQL server is down or is getting maintained or updated, it means users will not be able to write to the application. Unfortunately, this becomes one of the SPOFs in the infrastructure

HOMOGENEITY OF SERVERS: This is of paramount concern. Having servers that are identical in all respects can pose a single point of failure in the design. It means a single vulnerability or bug can affect all of them at once, culminating in bad user experience and loss for the company that owns the servers.
It also means there will be difficulty in growing the server farm by adding new servers with different configurations. Thus, the design limits the adaptability of the system to new technologies.
